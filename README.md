# TaylorPODA
This repository contains the implementation code associated with our research paper.  
The core functionalities are encapsulated within the `TaylorPODA_engine`.

- To reproduce the explanation results for a single input-output pair using **OCC-1**, **LIME**, **SHAP**, **WeightedSHAP**, and **TaylorPODA**,  
  please run `explain_concrete.py`. This enables a relatively fair comparison among different explanation methods.

- To generate an **approximated TaylorPODA explanation** for an MNIST image,  
  please run `MNIST.py`.
